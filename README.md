# Quail_Data_WTX

Due to the size of the .mat file (99 MB) and the current policy of Github, which only allows uploaded files to be less than 25 MB, I split the .mat file to small parts (<=20MB) using 7zip. 

## To get the .mat data file
1. Download all files on Data folder of this repo. This folder includes "Examples_221108.zip" file and several component files, such as "Examples_221108.z01".
2. On Window, on the downloaded files, right-click on the "Examples_221108.zip" file, then left click on "Extract Here".
